# Additions to the forked Project
This fork was created for the implementation of the new TwoTrees Sapphire Plus revision with unsynced Z-Axis drives and dual Endstops. Therefore new precompiler-dirctives have been added to the configuration.h and !configuration_adv.h!

It will also include preconfigurations for the E3D Hemera [mounted with this mount (Seems to work best on dual endstop-revs)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4435761). I remixed the mount for the useage of an EBM Pabst RLF35. [See Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4578322)

If you are more into the original GUI, that came with your printer, take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/RolfZuckowskiUltras/TwoTrees-Sapphire-Pro-Plus-Marlin2.0-with-GUI)
